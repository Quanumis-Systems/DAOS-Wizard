## Revision Schedule

This roadmap is reviewed and updated:
- Monthly for minor adjustments
- Quarterly for major updates
- Annually for strategic planning

## Progress Tracking

```typescript
const progressMetrics = {
    completed: getCompletedItems(),
    inProgress: getInProgressItems(),
    planned: getPlannedItems(),
    success: getSuccessMetrics()
};
```

*Note: Both documents are self-updating and evolve with the system. They automatically reflect current status, priorities, and progress.*
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more sections to either document
2. Enhance the metrics tracking
3. Include more detailed guidelines
4. Add more visualization components
5. Expand the milestone tracking

Let me know what aspects you'd like to enhance!
